I am excited to begin my academic journey as an incoming Ph.D. student at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/), where I will delve into the compelling interplay of artificial intelligence, programming languages, and software quality. My research, under the expert guidance of [Prof. Reid Holmes](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rtholmes/index.html) and [Prof. Caroline Lemieux](https://www.carolemieux.com/), will focus on Automated Program Repair, with a specific emphasis on auto-generating bug patches. This innovative research aims to revolutionize the way we approach software bugs, streamlining the repair process for greater efficiency and automation. I will also explore the critical role of bug-inducing inputs in debugging, a project that promises to enhance the efficacy of software development and maintenance.

Reflecting on my academic past, my transformative undergraduate experience at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) played a pivotal role in my development. My major in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics provided me with a deep understanding of intricate systems and their interrelations. This period of my life was marked by significant projects and research initiatives that sharpened my skills in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and innovation.

Professionally, my role as a Machine Learning Engineer at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) was a major turning point. I took the lead in redesigning the [ITOM Metric Intelligence](https://www.servicenow.com/products/metric-intelligence.html) Anomaly-Detection Capability, achieving a significant reduction in false positives by 67%. This role not only allowed me to apply AI in real-world scenarios but also enabled me to mentor new engineers, fostering a collaborative and knowledge-rich environment.

My journey in technology began in the vibrant city of New Delhi, India, a place where tradition and modernity converge. This unique blend of cultural and technological experiences has been a cornerstone in shaping my academic and professional paths. Stemming from a family with a strong educational background, I have always been passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge. This is evident from my experiences in tutoring at our family-owned school to mentoring university students. I believe in the power of combining academic rigor with nurturing mentorship to cultivate future innovators and thinkers.

As I look towards the future, I aim to contribute significantly to the fields of AI and machine learning, creating more intuitive and impactful tools for both academia and industry. My ultimate goal is to become a professor, where I can merge my love for teaching with my dedication to solving complex technological problems. In this role, I am committed to continuing my quest for knowledge and innovation, striving to make substantial contributions to computer science and inspiring the next generation of researchers and educators.
